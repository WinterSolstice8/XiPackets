# Character Information Structure

The character information structure, _referred to by the PS2 beta as `TC_OPERATION_MAKE`_, is a structure that contains information related to an individual Final Fantasy XI character. This structure is used within multiple packets sent to and from the `lobby` server.

For example, when creating a new character, the client will send this block of data in the `RequestCreateChr` packet with some of the information filled in. _(The bare minimum required to create a character.)_ When the client requests the available character list via `RequestGetChr`, the server will respond with `ResponseGetChr` which contains `n` number of instances of this structure for each available character. _The servers' responses that use this structure will have most of the information populated._

### world_no

_Unknown._

_This value is not used within the client. The server does set this value but unsure of its intended purpose. (It does not match the other world id values.)_

### GrapIDTbl

_The characters model id information._

The indexes into this table are as follows:

  - `0` - `Calculated model id for the characters race, face and hair.`
  - `1` - `Head model id.`
  - `2` - `Body model id.`
  - `3` - `Hands model id.`
  - `4` - `Legs model id.`
  - `5` - `Feet model id.`
  - `6` - `Main (weapon) model id.`
  - `7` - `Sub (weapon) model id.`

The first slot is a calculated model id using the characters chosen race, face and hair ids.\
That calculation is done as:

```cpp
uint16_t model_id = hair_no | (2 * (face_no | (mon_no << 7)));
```

### zone_no

_The characters current zone id._

_Note: This value is used with `zone_no2` in order to properly calculate the full zone id._

```cpp
uint16_t zone_id = zone_no + ((zone_no2 & 1) << 8);
```

### mjob_level

_The characters main job level._

### open_flag

_The characters current online status._

  - `0` - The character has marked their information as hidden. _(via `/anon`)_
  - `1` - The character has marked their information as visible. _(via `/anon off`)_

_This value is not used within the client. It appears this value is also sometimes inconsistent and not correctly marked according to the characters actual information status._

### GMCallCounter

_Unknown._

_This value is not used within the client. The value of this does not appear to be actually connected to the characters real GM call count._

### version

_Unknown._

_This value is not used within the client. It appears to always be set to 2._

### skill1

_The characters Fishing skill level._

### zone_no2

_The characters current zone id. (hi-byte)_

_Note: This value is used with `zone_no` in order to properly calculate the full zone id._

```cpp
uint16_t zone_id = zone_no + ((zone_no2 & 1) << 8);
```

_The characters Bastok rank value._

### TC_OPERATION_WORK_USER_RANK_LEVEL_WS_

_The characters Windurst rank value._

### ErrCounter

_Unknown._

_This value is not used within the client. It appears to always be set to 0._

### TC_OPERATION_WORK_USER_FAME_SD_COMMON_

_The characters San d'Oria fame amount._

_This value is not used within the client. It's value may not be what is expected based on the field name._

### TC_OPERATION_WORK_USER_FAME_BS_COMMON_

_The characters Bastok fame amount._

_This value is not used within the client. It's value may not be what is expected based on the field name._

### TC_OPERATION_WORK_USER_FAME_WS_COMMON_

### job_lev

_An array holding the levels of the characters base jobs. (FFXI + RoZ job levels. First slot is invalid/unused and always 1.)_

## General Notes

Because of when this structure is used, during `lobby` server transmissions, most of its data is otherwise useless and unused within the client. It is assumed that Square Enix makes use of this structure solely as a convenience when doing queries for character information on the server side. Rather than build out packets with the specific needed information, they just reuse this single structure. That means that it is likely the client is sent more information that is needed just because its auto-populated during the server-side query.

Several fields in this structure are also entirely unused by the normal client and do not appear to ever be populated on normal retail accounts. This is assumed to be due to potentially being used with the GM tooling instead.

_**Please note:** while the fields are named from their PS2 information, it is not guaranteed that any of these fields are solely used for that given purpose now, or at all. Some fields may have multiple purposes, or be entirely different now as these structures are literally from 2003. Some adjustments and naming have been made to align with the current PC version of the client._

## Usage: `RequestCreateChr`

When the client sends a `RequestCreateChr` request, only parts of the structure are populated.

The following fields are populated:

  - `mon_no`
  - `mjob_no`
  - `face_no`
  - `town_no`
  - `hair_no`
  - `size`
  - `GrapIDTbl` _(`GrapIDTbl[0]` is populated via the calculated information above.)_
  - `mjob_level`

_All other fields are nulled by default._

On retail, the other fields are ignored and not interpreted. Invalid values passed for the above fields will result in an error _(`321`)_ stating the character information is invalid.
